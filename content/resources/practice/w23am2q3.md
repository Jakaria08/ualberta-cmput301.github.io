**Use Case**

Write a use case for the task of a young person applying for a job based on the following scenario.

*I am 16 years old and looking for my first job, so I go to the MyFirstJob website. The website shows that the minimum age to work in Alberta is 15 and asks for my date of birth. I enter "2007-01-23". On the next page, there is a map showing all employers with current job openings. I use a filter to select the "Food" category. I see that a local coffee shop in my neighbourhood, "Café con Sabor," is looking for a part-time barista. I know a lot about coffee from my parents, so this sounds like a good fit! I click on "Café con Sabor" and see the application form. I go ahead and fill it out. Then I have to upload a resume. I try to upload my resume in DOCX format, but I get an error message: "Only PDF is supported". I upload the PDF, and the site displays the message "Application submitted!" and a happy face emoticon.*

- Use case name
