**UML Class Diagram to Java**

Convert this UML class diagram about the parameciums (a fancy microbe) to skeletal Java Code. Include all attributes and obviously public methods. Make sure all required methods are implemented. Include all generalizations and necessary associations. You may use ellipses (...) to indicate there is some code in the method but it's a midterm and who has time to write that code!

ACCOMMODATIONS: If you need a textual version of this UML output.pdf is available for you.
