**CRC Cards**

Engage in Object-Oriented Analysis and read the following scenario paragraph and pull out potential nouns that may lead to classes and verbs that may lead to methods or relationships.

Make CRC cards to model each meaningful class relevant to the problem and scenario. Collaborators and responsibilities must be described.

You may use plain text, and separate the cards by a blank line. The following format is recommended:

```
Class: X

Collaborator: Y

Collaborator: Z

Responsibility: K

Responsibility: L

Responsibility: M
```

*I see that the class that I take is scheduled in TEL 150. I have never taken a class in this classroom before, so I open the RateMyUofAClassroom app. It shows a long list of rooms. I start typing “TEL 1”, and the app suggests “TEL 150”. I click it and see that this classroom has an average rating of 4.3, nice! I go to my class and actually like the room a lot. I open the app and give the room a 5. The average rating is updated, it's now 4.4! What if I try to rate it again? No, I get an error message saying "You have already rated this classroom.”*
