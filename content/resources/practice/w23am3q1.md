**Scenario to Sequence Diagram**

Convert this scenario into a sequence diagram. Remember to include all the actors, components, lifelines, activation boxes and guards (conditions). Use good names for the methods.  

_My car needs gas, so I drive to the nearest gas station. I swipe my debit card at the pump. The pump connects to the processing center to authorize the card for the default amount of $100, and if there are sufficient funds in my account, the processing center confirms successful authorization. Next, I select Regular and the pump dispenses the selected grade of gasoline. It then asks the processing center to charge my card and receives a transaction ID in response. The pump asks if I want a receipt. The pump prints a receipt only if I tap Yes._**
