# Project Problem Description Surprise
### Expense Items / Driving

As a claimant, I want to record the starting location, ending location, and distance for a drive and attach this information to an editable expense item with the private automobile category.

As a claimant, I want the driving locations to come from GPS or allow me to set the locations.

As a claimant, I want the driving distance to be estimated from the starting and ending locations or allow me to set the distance in kilometres.

As a claimant, I want to take a photograph of an odometer and attach the photograph to the starting location or the ending location of a drive.

### Expense Claims / Communication

As a claimant, I want to email all the details of an expense claim, organizing the expense items by the categories, in the order of air fare, ground transport, vehicle rental, private automobile, fuel, parking, registration, accommodation, meal, then supplies.

As a claimant, I want a notification when an expense claim is returned or approved, and there is connectivity.

### Expense Claims / Native Currency

As a claimant, I want to note my native currency in which payments are made.

As a claimant, I want each expense item for which a foreign currency value was entered and later replaced by the equivalent native currency value to keep a record of the foreign currency value.

As a claimant, I want to compute the expense amount of a private automobile expense item by entering a rate in the native currency per kilometer and multiplying that rate by the distance traveled.

### Expense Items / Receipt Reading

As a claimant, I want to request that a photograph attached to an editable expense item be read, so that the date, category, textual description, amount spent, and unit of currency is entered for me when there is connectivity.

As a claimant, I want an indicator to show whether a receipt read request succeeded or failed.

As a receipt reader, I want to view receipt reading requests, and for each one, update the associated expense item with the date, category, textual description, amount spent, and unit of currency, and indicate success or failure.
