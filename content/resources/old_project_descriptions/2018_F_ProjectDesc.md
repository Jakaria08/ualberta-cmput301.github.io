# Project Problem Description
Warning: This is subject to change!

You are to design and implement a simple, attractive, and easy-to-use Android application to satisfy the following goals. Your design must be flexible enough to allow developers to extend or migrate it.

## User's Problem Description
I went to my doctor and had a physical. It was embarassing. The doctor pointed out some spots and asked if I had seen them before. I wasn't sure, so neither put pushed the issue any further. We didn't know, so we weren't going to do anything. Another time I went to the doctor and had the doctor investigate a spot on my hand. The doctor asked me if it had changed, I wasn't sure. The doctor asked me if it had grown, I said I assume so because why am I noticing it now. The doctor shrugged, said it looked alright and told me to keep track of it. Come back if it changed.



I can't remember if it changes, to prove something changed I need evidence. I could take photos of my whole body and keep them in a safe place, but would I remember to take the photos again and consistently? I also would like to take notes as well.



Thus I want software that will run on my phone and allow me to take photos of skin issues and notes about medical issues I might have. These photos and notes will be for my own sanity as well I can provide them to physicians when they are needed.



Each photo or note should be timestamped and associated with a problem. Each photo or note should optionally be mapped to a location. Each photo or note should be associated with a location on my body which I can indicate by clicking on paper-doll-cut-out-like image of myself. So if my left arm was affected, I'd click on my left arm on a picture of myself--that body location would recorded. If I suffer headaches near smokestacks I probably want to record the GPS location as well.



Thus as a user I want to be able to track and document medical issues. I want to use my cellphone to help me document all the blemishes and marks, and other stuff on my body such that I can keep track of them.

### "Wow" Factor
Non-trivial, visible requirement(s) of your choice that fit with the app, on approval from your TA. This should be decided for the initial use cases.

An example could be a nice UI for the paper-cut-out-doll view. Another could be dealing with records (that have locations) from a map view.

Another wow factor could be encryption---if you can encrypt photos that are uploaded.
