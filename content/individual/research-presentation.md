# Overview

**This assignment is for graduate students (CMPUT 501) only. CMPUT 402 students do not complete this assignment.**

The goal of this assignment is to read, understand, and present recent research related to the QA topics we've covered in class.

# Requirements

1. Choose a recent full length conference paper or journal article about any of the topics we've covered in class.
    * Must be from the last two years.
    * Must focus on one of the QA topics we've covered in class.
2. Send your choice of paper to the instructor **by March 15th.**
    * The instructor will approve or deny it based on its relevance to the course content, and the above requirements.
3. Read and understand the paper.
    * If you've never done this kind of thing before, you may also need to take a look at least at the abstracts of the important works it cites, so that you have a full understanding of the context.
4. Present the paper to the class:
    * a. Your presentation must be targeted to the audience, which is the undergrads who are in the class.
    * b. Presentation should be at between 25-30 minutes, no more, no less.
    * c. Presentation should cover all the aspects of the paper: background, research questions/hypothesis, experimental design, results, conclusions the authors drew about it.
    * d. If you use diagrams or statements from the paper or other papers they must be cited.
    * e. You can use PowerPoint or Google Slides or whatever presentation software you like.
    * f. You will need to present in class.
5. You must be able to answer questions about the paper for 5-10 minutes afterwards:
    * a. Even if the undergrads decide to skip class or not ask any questions, rest assured that I will be asking you questions.
    * b. You are expected to attend each other's presentations and ask questions.
