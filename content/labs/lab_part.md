# Lab 1 Participation Exercise

Due : Friday, 12 January 2024, 4:00 PM

Note: Proper completion of this exercise is considered as part of course participation.

1. Add three new model classes to LonelyTwitter: the first should be an abstract base class which represents the current mood. The second and third should be non-abstract classes which represent different moods (Ex: happy, sad, etc.) and inherit from the abstract class.

2. Each mood should have a date and getters and setters to access the date.

3. A constructor which sets the date to a default and a constructor which takes a date as an argument should be provided. 

4. Encapsulation should be followed.

5. Each mood should have a method which returns a string representing that mood.

6. Your new code should have examples of classes, methods, attributes, access modifiers, encapsulation, constructors, inheritance and abstract base classes.
