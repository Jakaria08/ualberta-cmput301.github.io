# Lab 2 Participation Exercise

Due: Friday, 19 January 2024, 4:00 PM
Note: Proper completion of this exercise is considered as part of course participation.

Task: Modify/Expand ListyCity to allow for the addition of new cities as well as the deletion of existing ones in the ListView. The specifics of the design of this functionality are up to you.

If you could not attend the labs or do not have the code for ListyCity, follow the instructions in Lab 2 ListView Example - Instructions. 

Hints:

1. You may want to use the OnClickListener methods discussed in the lab.

2. Ideally you should consider treating the cities as objects, however, in this exercise it may not be necessary.


Here are some screenshots from an example application that demonstrate the required functionality. 

**Your app does not need to look exactly like this demo！！！**

1. Press "ADD CITY" then type the name and press "CONFIRM".          2. Tap a city name to select it and then press "DELETE CITY" to remove
This adds a new city name to the listview.                                               the city from the listview.

You should submit your exercise as the project folder in the format of a zip archive.

**Due Date**

Friday after the Thursday lab at 4PM
