# Project Part 0

**Due:** Monday, 22 January 2024, 4:00 PM

## **Team Members**

Project teams consist of 6 members and each member must be registered in the same lab section.

The intent is that all members are available together for a good block of time during the week, to regularly meet their assigned TA, and to attend their project demos in their registered lab, without potentially overloading the lab section.

You can propose a partial team if you need the instructor to fill in the missing members.

## **Submission Procedure**
One member of your team must send a plaintext email to both instructors with the specific subject line:
CMPUT301 Team
and a message body that lists the CCIDs of the members, one per line prefixed by the weekday of the lab section. For example:

Tuesday

gorman
bishop
hicks
ferro
drake
vasquez
