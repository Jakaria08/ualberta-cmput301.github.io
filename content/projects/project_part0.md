# Team Members

Project teams consist of 6 members and each member must be registered in the **same lab section.**

The intent is that all members are available together for a good block of time during the week, to regularly meet their assigned TA, and to attend their project demos in their registered lab, without potentially overloading the lab section.

For an initial teamwork exercise you will be asked to pick a team name according to the exact specifications below.

# What to submit

Every team member will need to submit the following:

* The lab section (Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursday)
* Each team member's CCID
* Each team member's name
* Each team member's GitHub username
* A proposed team name
    * Good examples: `kakuna`, `helium`, `orchid`, `magnet`, `indigo`
    * Exactly six (6) ASCII lowercase letters
    * A single english word
    * Must be professional
        * Sexism/Racism/etc. or any other harassment will be brought to the Dean of Students for sanctions
        * Must not contain any insults
    * Must not contain anyone's name as a substring
    * Should be unique
        * Words like `heroes`, `awesome`,  are overused: they'll be accepted but might conflict with another team, if they conflict, the second team to submit will be assigned a different name.

# Submission Procedure

All members of the team must submit the google form... link coming soon.

# Marking

* If you do not form a team before the due date, you will recieve a mark of zero.
* If you do not submit on time, you will recieve a mark of zero. No late submissions are allowed. No extensions will be granted.
* Every team member must submit. If you don't submit you will recieve a mark of zero even if your other team members submitted.
* You will be deducted one mark for each violation of the required submission format!
    * This includes using a student ID instead of a CCID, or using a name instead of a CCID, or using an email account instead of a CCID... etc.
    * This also includes violating the team name format
