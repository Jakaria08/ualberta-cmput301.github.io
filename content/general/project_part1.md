# Project Part 1

**Due:** Monday, 5 February 2024, 4:00 PM

**Learning Objectives**

+ Set up and use collaborative tools for team-based project development.

+ Collaborate in a team.

**Exercise**

Your team is expected to use GitHub for a git repository and wiki to share, manage, and store your project artifacts.

+ See the Project Teams page for the assigned name of your organization (e.g., CMPUT301W24T86).

+ Come up with a class project name, something interesting but respectful and professional.

+  Make a public git repository that is accessible at all times to team members, the TAs, and the instructor via GitHub. Record the repo URL.

+  Create a doc/ directory in your repository, create a team.txt file within doc/, and have each of your team members make a distinct, versioned edit to that file. For each member, that edit must be a line with their CCID and GitHub username separated by a space.

(Later in the course, project documentation will be done using the GitHub wiki.)

## **Submission Procedure**


NEW PROCEDURE: ONE MEMBER OF THE TEAM uses this google form to submit project part 1 [link](https://forms.gle/b15gtms6s4Jodpj89)

Alternatively you can do this, but the google form is preferred:

One member of the team must send a plaintext email to the course instructor with the subject line:
CMPUT301 Repo
and a message body with your team's repo URL.

The URL should be formatted like this:

https://github.com/Organization/ClassProjectName

This should be the git URL such that the TA can run:

git clone https://github.com/Organization/ClassProjectName

For example, the URL could be:

https://github.com/CMPUT301F22T86/NukeItFromOrbit

## **Hints**

This exercise can be completed with your team in the labs that cover git and GitHub.

Emails using the wrong subject line may be missed as submissions.
