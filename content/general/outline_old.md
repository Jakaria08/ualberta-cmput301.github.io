## Overview

As an introduction to software engineering, this course is about building software effectively. You will apply good practices, effective design techniques, and development tools within a team project to create an application with a graphical user interface.

The focus is largely practical, with broad coverage in topics such as: object-oriented design, user interfaces, unit testing, design patterns, and refactoring.

Communication skills, team dynamics, working with a "customer", and creativity are also important factors in the course project. The knowledge, skills, and experience you gain will be invaluable in your future software development projects.

## Objectives

We will learn about applying software engineering concepts to design and implement interactive applications.


One effective way to build such applications is to apply object-oriented design and use software components. To be useful to end users, the design of these applications must also be guided by usability principles. The course involves a team project in building a well-designed Java/Android application with a sophisticated graphical user interface.


By the end of this course, you will have a strong background in basic software engineering concepts. Also, you will have the skills to implement interactive applications in Android. You will learn to propose and think critically about software and user interface designs.


Students are expected to participate in all classes and labs.

### Exams:

**There is no possibility of a reexamination in this course.**

The final exam is tentatively scheduled for: Monday, December 13 starting at 14:00.

You must verify the date and time on BearTracks when the final exam schedule is posted.

### Grade Evaluation:

The individualized project score depends on the following main factors: how well your team did, the peer review forms of your team members, your completion of peer review forms, and the instructor and TAs' assessment of your individual contribution.


The conversion of your total numeric coursework score to a final grade will be based on interpreting the guidelines of the descriptors, letter grading system, and four-point scale as defined in the University Calendar ยง23.4. That is, grades are assigned on what we judge to be "failure", "minimal pass", "poor", "satisfactory", "good", or "excellent" performance in the context of the class.


We do not use a particular distribution to do the conversion, but instead use our judgement of how your score reflects mastery of the course material. That said, you generally need to be above the median to earn at least a 3.0 or B.

## Academic Integrity
The University of Alberta is committed to the highest standards of academic integrity and honesty. Students are expected to be familiar with these standards regarding academic honesty and to uphold the policies of the University in this respect. Students are particularly urged to familiarize themselves with the provisions of the Code of Student Behaviour (online at www.governance.ualberta.ca) and avoid any behaviour which could potentially result in suspicions of cheating, plagiarism, misrepresentation of facts and/or participation in an offence. Academic dishonesty is a serious offence and can result in suspension or expulsion from the University. (GFC 29 SEP 2003)
