# Course Content

## Course Description

As an introduction to software engineering, this course is about building software effectively. You will apply good practices, effective design techniques, and development tools within a team project to create an application with a graphical user interface.

The focus is largely practical, with broad coverage in topics such as: object-oriented design, user interfaces, unit testing, design patterns, and refactoring.

Communication skills, team dynamics, working with a "customer", and creativity are also important factors in the course project. The knowledge, skills, and experience you gain will be invaluable in your future software development projects.

## Prerequisites

CMPUT 201 or CMPUT 275

## Objectives and Learning Outcomes

We will learn about applying software engineering concepts to design and implement interactive applications.

One effective way to build such applications is to apply object-oriented design and use software components. To be useful to end users, the design of these applications must also be guided by usability principles. The course involves a team project in building a well-designed Java/Android application with a sophisticated graphical user interface.

By the end of this course, you will have a strong background in basic software engineering concepts. Also, you will have the skills to implement interactive applications in Android. You will learn to propose and think critically about software and user interface designs.

Students are expected to participate in all classes and labs.

## Course Topics

* software engineering
* object-oriented analysis and development
* Unified Modeling Language
* software processes
* requirements
* testing
* design patterns
* refactoring
* tools
* revision control
