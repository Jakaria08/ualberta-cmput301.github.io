# Marking

From the syllabus

> Missed Labs:

> Labs are due Friday at 5PM on the same week the lab was presented. Project meetings are due at the time of the meeting, and they are included in the lab mark. Failure to attend and actively participate in project meetings will result in a lab mark of zero.
> 
> The 2 lowest marks for Labs (including project meetings) will be dropped when calculating the course mark. No late labs will be accepted. Failure to complete a lab (or to attend a project meeting) on time for any reason will result in a mark of zero. Please note that you can miss 2 labs (or project meetings) without penalty.

## Labs are marked as follows:

Given `N` total labs, count the number of sufficiently complete labs (`M`), calculate percent labs as `100% * M / (N - 2)`.

* Failure 0: Write less than 50% of labs
* Unsatisfactory 2: Write more than or equal to 50% of labs 
* Satisfactory 3: Write more than 60% of labs 
* Good 4: Write more than 70% of labs 
* Excellent 5: Write more than 80% of labs

You only get credit for labs in your own section.
