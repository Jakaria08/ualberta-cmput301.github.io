The Midterm Exams consist of three exams, each with three questions,
taking about 10 minutes each. You must complete your midterm during
your scheduled class timeâ€”only for your section. Taking the same
midterm twice is a violation of the Student Academic Integrity Policy,
and neither will be graded.

The midterm exams are closed book with a cheat sheet. No collaboration
is allowed. Solo and Confidential.

You should prepare a cheat sheet:

- 1 sheet double sided - US LETTER SIZE ONLY (8.5 inches by 11 inches)
- Does not need to be hand written, but should be so you learn better.
- Can not be shared, each cheat sheet has to be created individually.
- You will not get the cheat sheet back.

### Topics

The exam topics involve everything covered or presented in class up until the
day of the midterm exam.

Lecture topics include what is covered in class such as:  

- [Objects, UML, and Java]({filename}/general/slides.html#objects-uml-java)
- [Software Process]({filename}/general/slides.html#software-process)
- [Requirements]({filename}/general/slides.html#requirements)

Consult  the lecture slides and recordings, related MOOC resources (videos and
notes), class participation exercises, and practice questions. Know Java  and
the covered UML diagrams.  

The exam questions are very similar to our in class exercises.
