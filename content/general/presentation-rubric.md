# Overview

The purpose of the presentation marking rubric is to outline precise evaluation criteria for the assessment of the group assignment 5 presentation. Its aim is to provide clear guidance to presenters, ensuring they have a thorough understanding of what is expected of them.

# Requirements

1. Slides
    * Make sure to use readable fonts.
    * Use short phrases instead of paragraphs of text. Avoid crowded text-only slides.
    * Use pictures, diagrams etc., whenever possible.
    * Add slide numbers so that it is easy to ask questions about specific slides.
2. Delivering the talk
    * Be positive and (pretend to be?) interested and excited.
    * Speak loudly and clearly & avoid being monotonous.
    * Face the audience and look at them and try to engage the audience.
    * Make your talk entertaining (without overdoing it).
    * Rehearse your presentation well enough that you donâ€™t need to keep reading off your slides. If you are always reading off the slides, then  the audience could simply read your slides and not listen to you at all.
    * Anticipate things you need to highlight and use boxes etc to highlight them on the slides.
3. Present the project to the class
    * Your presentation must be targeted to the audience who are in the class.
    * Presentations will be done by group.
    * Presentation should be about 8 minutes, no more. Try NOT to wrap up the presentation really early. You MUST finish your presentation within the time constraints so please rehearse properly. You will lose 2 marks if you run over time.
    * Presentation should cover all the aspects of group assignment 5 including the five points which should be in the report.
    * You can use PowerPoint or Google Slides or whatever presentation software you like.
    * You will need to present in lab in person during lab time.
    * All group members will have to present.
4. You must be able to answer questions about the presentation and your work so far
    * You are expected to attend each other's presentations and ask questions.

# Evaluating Deliverables Based on Presentation Content

According to [Group Assignment 5: Technical Debt]({filename}/group/technical-debt.md), we will use both the content of your report and presentation to grade the 5 points from the deliverables. The weight of the content of the presentation for the main grading is given below:

1. Quality evaluation using SonarQube (points 1 and 2):  7.5 out of 30
2. Discussing current CI pipeline (point 3): 2.5 out of 10
3. Advice on paying back current debt (point 4): 3.75 out of 15
4. Discussion of metrics & tool changes (point 5): 2.5 out of 10

Total presentation content grade: 16.25 out of 70
