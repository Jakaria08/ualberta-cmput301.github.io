# Communication Expectations

Ask questions well before Assignment due dates. Although you have nothing to lose by trying, realize that while the course staff try to provide as much support as possible, they are not obliged to answer last-minute questions (i.e., those within less than 2 business days from the assignment due date). 

Please be polite, courteous, and professional.

We will not tolerate harassment, bullying, threats, intimidation, insults, lying, or creating any kind of environment that might discourage participation. Any such behavior is a violation of the [Student Conduct Policy](https://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Pages/DispPol.aspx?PID=190&s=https://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Pages/Academic.aspx) and subject to sanctions. Plagiarism, cheating, and lying are also violations of the [Student Academic Integrity Policy](https://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Pages/DispPol.aspx?PID=193&s=https://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Pages/Academic.aspx), and will be subject to sanctions.

# Where to NOT get help

<p class="warning">Do not ask for help on sites such as Discord, Telegram, WeChat, Snapchat...</p>

The only official communications are:

* University of Alberta Google Apps (forms / gmail / etc.) (you must be signed in with your CCID)
* eClass
* Canvas University of Alberta (future)

Additionally, you can submit assignments/projects/labs/participation on Github Classroom and Mentimeter, but do not use them to ask questions.

The instructor/TA are not responsible for and completely disown any unofficial communications.

People on unofficial discussion forums such as discord **sometimes lie**. There is no way to verify the people on Discord are even actually in the class. Previously on unofficial communications like Discord:

    * Multiple times, someone lied about a due date was later than it was, leading to students missing deadline and getting a zero.
    * Multiple times, Someone lied about something being required that was not, leading to students doing extra work for no reason.
    * Multiple times, Someone lied about something not being required that actually was, leading to students failing assignments.
    * A student gave someone on discord access to their computer, leading to money from their bank account being stolen.
    * Multiple times, someone lied about an instructor retiring when they actually weren't.
    * Someone lied about something being impossible, when it was actually easy, leading to multiple students doing a bunch of extra work.
    * Multiple times, someone pasted code, leading to Plagiarism sanctions against multiple students by the University such as grade reductions, academic probation, being denied graduation.

Multiple lies like the above happen on Discord or another unofficial site for this class **every semester**.

Behavior such as harassment, bullying, threats, intimidation, insults, racism, lying are still subject to sanctions by the [Student Conduct Policy](https://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Pages/DispPol.aspx?PID=190&s=https://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Pages/Academic.aspx) and the [Student Academic Integrity Policy](https://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Pages/DispPol.aspx?PID=193&s=https://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Pages/Academic.aspx). However, because the instructor and University has no control of these platforms we also do not have any way to stop or control harassment, bullying, threats, intimidation, insults, racism, lying
