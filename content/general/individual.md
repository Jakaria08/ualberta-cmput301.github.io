# Participation

You can earn lecture participation credit by attending lecture on time and doing a lecture participation exercise. Instructions will be given during lecture.

<!-- <p class="warning">Do <em>not</em> enter your real name, CCID, or student ID into Mentimeter.</p> -->

These will be done on paper and you need to bubble in your student number. 

* You must provide your student number to get credit. Failure to do so will not earn credit. <!-- **Your codename can be found under feedback at the top of your grades in eClass.** -->
<!--    * You will not get credit for your real name, CCID, or student ID! -->
* For lecture participation exercises, given N total exercises only N-6 will be counted. You can miss 6. No extensions, excused absences, or weight transfers are possible. See the [outline]({filename}/general/outline.md#missed-term-work-participation) for more information.
<!--
* Entering answers in Mentimeter without attending the course, either in-person or on Zoom will be considered a violation of the Student Academic Integrity Policy.
-->
* Entering answers for someone else will be considered a violation of the SAIP.  <!--    * Sharing the Menti link with other students will be considered a violation of the SAIP. -->
    * See the [outline section on contract cheating]({filename}/general/outline.md#contract-cheating-cs-courses) for more information.

## Participation Exercises are marked as follows:

Given `N` total exercises, count the number of sufficiently complete exercises (`M`), calculate percent exercises as `100% * M / (N - 6)`.

* Failure 0: Write less than 50% of exercises
* Unsatisfactory 4: Write more than or equal to 50% of exercises and labs
* Satisfactory 6: Write more than 60% of exercises and labs
* Good 7: Write more than 70% of exercises and labs
* Excellent 8: Write more than 80% of exercises and labs

If you participate enough in discussion you can get 1 bonus mark to
your participation grade (not exceeding 7). You only get credit for
participation in your own section.
