**Class Participation Exercise 13**

Proper completion of this exercise is considered as part of course participation. An answer will be discussed in class.

Apply the decorator design pattern to represent the structure of a pizza and for calculating its total cost.

Starting with a base (e.g., thick crust), you can decorate with successive toppings (e.g., rich sauce, then pepperoni, then cheese). Each base or topping has a specific incremental cost to add to the total cost.

Draw a UML class diagram that applies the decorator pattern for the structure of the above base and toppings.

Submit your diagram as a PNG file.
