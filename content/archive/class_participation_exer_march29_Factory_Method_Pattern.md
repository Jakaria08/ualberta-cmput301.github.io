## Problem

### Design a framework using the Factory Method Pattern for:

- Application and Document superclasses 
- And an actual application would make these:
    - Add MyApplication and MyDocument subclasses
    - add YourApplication and YourDocument subclasses

## Write a general newDocument method in Application that ultimately instantiates a MyDocument if your application is a MyApplication.

1. Draw the UML class diagram for the above problem using the Factory Method Pattern using concrete and abstract classes.
2. What is the code in MyApplication for the method newDocument?
