**Class Participation Exercise**

Design and create a sequence diagram for a system that allows users to customize a car using the decorator pattern. It might be helpful to sketch the class diagram, but it's not required, only the sequence diagram is required.

Use the decorator pattern to implement a simulator, a car and some upgrades that can be applied to the car. The car has some basic properties like model, color, speed, and price. A variety of upgrades are available such as a V8 engine, a turbocharger, a spoiler, and racing tires.

Make a sequence diagram that shows the interaction between the objects when it constructs a car with at least 2 upgrades and then computes its price.

Do not submit Java, submit UML **Sequence Diagram**. <br><br><br>

**Add your name and your partner's name (if you have one) to the diagram. If you don't, you won't get credit.**

Upload a screenshot. If you worked in a pair, get the screenshot from your partner and upload the same screenshot.

You can screenshot a diagrammer of your choice, or draw it on paper and take a photo.
Here's a handy diagrammer online: https://app.diagrams.net/ IF that one doesn't work for you, try a different one.
