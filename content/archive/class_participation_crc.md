**Class Participation Exercise: CRC Cards**

**Instructions:** You are tasked with the Object Oriented Analysis (OOA) of the following problem. Please make CRC cards (Class Reponsibility Collaboration) for each meaningful class.

I want to see if a skin-blemish changes over time. To prove that a blemish changes I need evidence (photos). I would like to take photos of these blemishes over time and store them in a safe place. I want the photos to be taken consistently. These photos can be provided to physicians when needed.

Example format:
